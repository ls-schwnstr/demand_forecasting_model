# Demand Forecasting Model for Taxis in NYC

In this project, data science techniques are applied to predict the taxi demand in ten different areas in New York throughout the day by analyzing six months of GPS data and the start times of the company's vehicles.The approach integrates the building of both a SARIMA model and a XGboost prediction model.
